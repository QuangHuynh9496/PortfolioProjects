-- Scenario
There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.

-- Experienced SQL sleuths start here
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

-- Chanllenge find the murder with no more than 2 queries
SELECT *
FROM crime_scence_reprot

SELECT p.id, p.name, d.plate_number
FROM ((( interview as i JOIN person as p ON i.person_id = p.id )
 JOIN get_fit_now_member as gym_member ON p.id = gym_member.person_id)
 JOIN get_fit_now_check_in as gym_check ON gym_member.id = gym_check.membership_id)
 JOIN drivers_license as d ON p.license_id = d.id
WHERE p.name IN ('Carmen Dimick','Jeremy Bowers','Annabel Miller') OR d.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%'
GROUP BY p.name
-- Check your solution
Did you find the killer?

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
  SELECT value
  FROM solution;

-- Querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime
SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id ='67318'

-- The murder said " I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017 "
