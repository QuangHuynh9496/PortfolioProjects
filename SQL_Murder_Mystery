-- Scenario
There's been a Murder in SQL City! The SQL Murder Mystery is designed to be both a self-directed lesson to learn SQL concepts and commands and a fun game for experienced SQL users to solve an intriguing crime.

-- Experienced SQL sleuths start here
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

-- Looking for infomation about crime scene
SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = '20180115' AND type ='murder' AND city ='SQL City'

-- Investigate information from witnesses
SELECT i.transcript, p.name, p.address_number, p.address_street_name
FROM interview as i JOIN person as p ON i.person_id = p.id
WHERE p.address_street_name ='Northwestern Dr' OR  p.name LIKE 'Annabel' OR p.address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
ORDER BY p.address_number DESC

-- Continue to investigate from the information gathered
SELECT gym_member.id, gym_member.name, gym_member.membership_status, gym_check.check_in_date, d.plate_number
FROM ((( interview as i JOIN person as p ON i.person_id = p.id )
 JOIN get_fit_now_member as gym_member ON p.id = gym_member.person_id)
 JOIN get_fit_now_check_in as gym_check ON gym_member.id = gym_check.membership_id)
 JOIN drivers_license as d ON p.license_id = d.id
WHERE (gym_member.membership_status ='gold' AND gym_member.id LIKE '48Z%') OR gym_check.check_in_date ='20180109' OR d.plate_number LIKE '%H42W%'
GROUP BY gym_member.name  

-- Check my solution
I just finded the MURDER

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
  SELECT value
  FROM solution;
  
-- We can see Full Infomation about the Murder
SELECT *
FROM person
JOIN drivers_license ON person.license_id = drivers_license.id
WHERE name ='Jeremy Bowers'

-- Querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime
SELECT *
FROM interview
WHERE person_id ='67318'

-- The murder said " I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017 "
